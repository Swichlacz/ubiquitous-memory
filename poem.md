# __The Outlaw__ by *Bliss Carman (William)*

    Oh, let my lord laugh in his halls
    When he the tale shall tell!
    But woe to Jarlwell and its walls
    When I shall laugh as well!
    And he that laughs the last, lads,
    Laughs well, laughs well!

    He's lord of many a burg and farm
    And mickle thralls and gold,
    And I am but my own right arm,
    My dwelling-place the wold.
    But when we twain meet face to face,
    He will hot laugh so bold.

    The shame he chuckles as he shows
    This time he need not tell;
    I'll give his body to the crows,
    And his black soul to Hell.
    For he that laughs the last, lads,
    Laughs well, laughs well!
